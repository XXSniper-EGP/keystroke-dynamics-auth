# Keystroke Dynamics Authentication

Web app for user authentication using keystroke dynamics (typing rhythm) as an extra security layer on top of a traditional password-based login, built with Flask.

A graduation project that collects typing patterns, trains a machine learning model, and verifies users based on their keystroke dynamics after password login.
